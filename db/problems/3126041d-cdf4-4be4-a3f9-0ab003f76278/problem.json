She is writing a function that takes a polygon (defined as a list of vertices), translates it along the x and/or y axes, and renders the output to the screen. However, somewhere in Erica's code, the output points are being scrambled after they are translated!\n\nYou are given the input polygon's vertices as (x, y) points in order. You are also given the output polygon's *scrambled* vertices. Given these sets of data, can you determine what the translation was on the x and y axes?\n\n![Scrambled Polygons](https://i.ibb.co/hBWMmVt/scrambled-polygons.png)\n\n<style>\nimg {\n  max-width: 50%;\n\t  box-shadow: 0 0 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n\t}\n</style>", "input": "The first line contains one integer, **Q**, the number of queries.
