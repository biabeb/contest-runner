They also like to invent new games. Tom came up with an idea for a game and proposed it to Jerry. Tom will have a list of numbers in no specific order. Tom and Jerry will take turns. On each turn, the player removes a single number from the list. However, they cannot remove whatever number they choose - they must remove the largest number remaining in the list. The first player who has no numbers left to remove loses the game.\n\nJerry always plays first. Can you determine who will win the game, given the list of numbers?", "input": "The first line contains one integer **N**: the number of integers in the list for the game.\n\nThe next line contains **N** integers describing the game's list.", "output": "Output \"Tom\" if Tom wins the game, otherwise output \"Jerry\".", "constraints": "* 1 &le; **N** &le; 10<sup>5</sup>\n* -10<sup>4</sup> &le; **N<sub>i</sub>** &le; 10<sup>4</sup>", "samples": 1, "tests": 21, "timelimit": "5"}
