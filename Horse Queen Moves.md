# Horse Queen Moves
## Description
It's a chess queen... but is it really?

## Statement
Jacob really likes playing chess, and he started wondering how many moves it would take for a queen to move from one point
on a chess board to another point. Jacob treats a single move as one of the following:

* One space up, down, left, or right
* One space diagonally
* One knight move (2 spaces vertically and 1 horizontally, or 1 vertically and 2 horizontally)

Since Jacob isn't very good at programming, can you help him figure out how many moves it should take to move his queen?

## Input
Input consists of 6 integers on one line: **W**, **H**, **x<sub>1</sub>**, **y<sub>1</sub>**, **x<sub>2</sub>**, and **y<sub>2</sub>**, where **W** is the width of the board and **H** is the height of the board, and **x<sub>1</sub>**, **y<sub>1</sub>**, **x<sub>2</sub>**, and **y<sub>2</sub>** give the row- and column of the starting and target squares, respectively.

## Output
Output consists of a single integer, the number of moves the queen must make to travel from (**x<sub>1</sub>**, **y<sub>1</sub>**) to (**x<sub>2</sub>**, **y<sub>2</sub>**).

## Constraints
1 &le; **W**, **H**, **x<sub>1</sub>**, **y<sub>1</sub>**, **x<sub>2</sub>**, **y<sub>2</sub>** &le; 100
